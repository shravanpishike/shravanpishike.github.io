                Why I Travel
            </h5>
        <p>
            
            I believe that travel is so much more than simply seeing the sights – that travel, and the things you learn
            from it, can really change your life.

            I travel to grow as a person, to meet others who inspire and educate me and to (hopefully!) do the same in
            return, to have my life enriched by the beauty and diversity of this amazing world and to have my eyes, mind
            and heart opened wide.

            I travel to make the most of my time on earth, to make every day count, instead of counting down the days
            till the weekend or to a 2 week vacation – because life is simply too short for me to live it any other way!

      <h5>Places to visit</h5>
      <em>
        The world is filled with such a wide variety of wonderful destinations and beautiful places to visit, it can be
        quite difficult to compile a list of the best ones. Thinking about a traveler who, for whatever reason, has
        never set foot outside his or her home town, where would be the first places they might visit?

        The list of the world's best places to visit has to include great cities, like New York, Paris, London, and so
        on, each of which is filled with a multitude of individual sites or must-see places to visit. The list also
        includes specific sites, monuments, and locations, each also worthy of a visit in their own right.

        For more ideas on where to go and what to see, read our list of the top places to visit in the world.

      <h5>Cuisines to try</h5>
      <em>
        Traveling the world and experiencing the different cultures and cuisines is something we all dream about. Well
        if you are a foodie like me, then you probably mostly dream about trying all the different types of exotic
        cuisines but the problem is where do you start? How do you know what you will like, and what you should try? I
        have the perfect solution for you! Howard Hillmans pretty much devoted his whole life to traveling around the
        world discovering the hidden wonders of it, through culture, people and food. Indonesian cuisine varies greatly
        by region and has many different influences. The food is usually chili hot and complexly seasoned with aromatic
        herbs and spices. “Bland” does not exist in their vocabulary.
        “Turkish cuisine is a Middle Eastern culinary marriage – and the nation has some of the most dedicated and
        talented cooks on earth.” -Howard Hillman.

      <h5>Best Accomodations to stay-in</h5>
      <em>
        Those of us who love adventure travel are familiar with the saying, “it’s the journey, not the destination”.
        Whether it’s walking with camels in the Australian desert, traversing Costa Rica by raft, kayaking in the
        Antarctic or trekking in the Himalayas, “getting there” is all part of the adventure. As is where our travellers
        sleep each night.

        From sleeping in a traditional Japanese ryokan, staying in a treehouse in South Africa for a true ‘bush feeling’
        or spending the night at a striking campsite in the heart of Australia’s outback. If you're looking to sleep
        somewhere more inspiring than the four walls of a hotel on your next trip, this list offers exciting
        'alternative’ accommodations set in beautifully unique places when travelling with World Expeditions.

      <h5>Travel hacks</h5>
      <em>
        With 57 countries under my belt and more than a decade of traveling regularly, I think it’s safe to say that I’m
        an expert in the field. I’ve made every mistake you could imagine—missed flights, lost baggage, exploding hair
        irons—but with each disastrous experience, I’ve grown a little bit wiser, and a LOT savvier when it comes to
        traveling like a seasoned pro.

        These travel hacks for flying, packing, saving money, getting hotel upgrades and more are the secrets I swear
        by. I hope they’ll help make your next trip pleasurable, memorable, and stress-free.
        There’s nothing worse than getting stuck in a seat that doesn’t recline, or ending up in a row next to the
        lavatory with people hovering over you for the entire flight.
        Occasionally, I’ll even choose a flight based on the type of plane that SeatGuru tells me I’ll be flying on. The
        website and app shows you photos of the plane’s interior so you’ll know in advance whether you’re booking an
        outdated 747, or a brand spanking new plane.
